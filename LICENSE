2. Provenance for LLM-Assisted Modifications.
   Any person who modifies the Software and redistributes the modified version

     - Model version or date

   The provenance record may be provided in a commit message, code comment,

3. LLM-Generated Material Disclaimer.
   The Software may include material generated or assisted by LLMs.
   Contributors cannot verify and do not warrant the originality, authorship,
   accuracy, or non-infringing nature of such material. LLM output may

   own risk.

   If you discover potential copyright issues, missing attribution, or material
   that may need removal or clarification, you are encouraged to notify the
   maintainers or open an issue so the project can address it promptly.

   The VIBE License remains fully permissive regardless of whether these checks are
   performed.

5. Responsible Review and Reporting (Optional).
   Users and contributors are encouraged, but not required, to perform reasonable
   checks to identify any potential reuse of copyrighted material, including the
   use of publicly available code-similarity or plagiarism-detection tools.
   Such checks are conducted solely at the user's discretion and do not create
   any warranty, duty, or liability for contributors.

   If a user becomes aware of possible copyright infringement, improper reuse,
   or a need for additional attribution in the Software, the user is encouraged
   to notify the maintainers or submit a corrective contribution. Providing such
   notice is voluntary and does not affect the rights granted by this License.
